# Development and Simulation of a Control System for Sailing Vessels using Virtual Reality (Unity)


# Summary
This project presents an in-depth overview of the development and simulation of a sailboat control system using virtual reality. By integrating physics laws, designing an intuitive user interface, establishing system specifications, and addressing ethical considerations, we have created an immersive and educational platform for individuals to acquire practical knowledge and skills in sailboat control.

# Future planned updates

-> More detailed environmental factors such as tidal currents, wave patterns, and underwater terrain to provide a more realistic representation of sailing conditions.

-> Integration of machine learning algorithms could also analyze user performance and provide personalized feedback for skill improvement.

-> Multiplayer functionality

-> Add comprehensive training materials, tutorials, and educational resources within the application.

-> Add the ability to control the sails
